# Becoming an SAP Partner

To become a SAP partner, you have to fulfil the prerequisites to be able to develop, publish, market a solution on SAP BTP and sell and deploy to your customers.

For new partners, apply online at <a href="https://www.sap.com/partner/become.html" target="_blank">SAP.com</a> 

Join SAP PartnerEdge Open Ecosystem, register for PartnerEdge Build, submit a solution for Application Readiness Check (ARC) and complete Due Diligence.

Partners must complete and return their PartnerEdge agreement (via digital signature) and the PartnerEdge program fee must be received before a partner is onboarded. 

Existing partners can request additional partner types via **Manage My Partnership**.
