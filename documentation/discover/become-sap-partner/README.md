# Become an SAP Partner

To become an SAP partner, you have to fulfill the prerequisites to be able to develop, publish, market a solution on SAP BTP, and sell and deploy to your customers.

For new partners, apply online at [SAP.com](https://www.sap.com/partner/become.html).

Join SAP PartnerEdge Open Ecosystem, register for PartnerEdge Build, submit a solution for Application Readiness Check (ARC) and complete Due Diligence.

Partners must complete and return their PartnerEdge agreement (via digital signature) and the PartnerEdge program fee must be received before a partner is onboarded.

Existing partners can request additional partner types via **Manage My Partnership**.
