# Learn the basics of SAP BTP

SAP Business Technology Platform is the extension platform from SAP. It enables developers to implement loosely coupled extension applications securely, thus implementing additional workflows or modules on top of the existing SAP cloud solution they already have. Before starting with developing extension applications, you need to understand how SAP Cloud Platform is structured so you can choose the best components for your use case.

Pay attention on the Cloud Foundry environment, global accounts and subaccounts. The automated extension configuration is not available on trial.
