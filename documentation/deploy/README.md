# Deploy

In this section you will learn how to deploy all components in your Kyma cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Have all the tools listed in the section [Set Up the Development Environment](/documentation/prepare/set-up-local-environment/README.md) installed
- Have all properties necessary for the JDBC connection prepared. See section [Get and Configure your SAP HANA Cloud Instance](/documentation/prepare/configure-hana/README.md)
- Have the username and password for email account you are going to use

## Deployment Options

 In the following sections, we will explain two options to deploy the components. There is a [complete manual way](/documentation/deploy/manual-deployment/README.md) of deploying the components or you can use the [build scripts](/documentation/deploy/script-deployment/README.md) which are provided in each subfolder of the components.  Essentially the scripts do the same as explained in the manual deployment sections so we recommend to go through the manual deployment once to understand what is happening within the scripts. Either way,  there are some [common tasks](/documentation/deploy/prepare-deployment/README.md) that need to be done before the actual deployment of the components which are described in the following section.

## Section Content
