# [OPTIONAL] Test Multitenancy

As the this tutorial explains how to create a multitenant application, you probably want to test the multitenancy. In the previous sections, we have onboard the customer City Scooter. We have prepared some dat in the Business Partner mock server to onboard a second customer called Bike Sharing. This is of course optional and not needed fo the rest of the tutorial.

To onboard a second customer, you need of course to go through the following steps again:
* [Create customer subaccount](../create-consumer-subaccount/README.md)
* [Configure destination](../configure-destination/README.md)
* [Subscribe EasyFranchise application](../subscribe-easyfranchise-app/README.md)
* [Manage Users](../manage-users/README.md)
* [Run Application](../run-application/README.md)
