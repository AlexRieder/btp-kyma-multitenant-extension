# SAP S/4HANA Cloud or Business Partner Mock Server

You can either use SAP S/4HANA Cloud to run our application or you can use our mock service, if you do not have or do not want to use a real S/4 system. This page describes both variants.

## SAP S/4HANA Cloud

To use SAP S/4HANA Cloud you have to connect our application to an S/4 system. From all the functionality offered by S/4 we only need access to BusinessPartner OData V2 Rest API.

Please read here how to [Enable the Business Partner OData V2 Rest API in an S/4HANA Cloud system](../../../appendix/enable-odata-of-s4hana/README.md)
