# Easy Franchise

## Description
The application Easy Franchise has been build to help stakeholders to learn how to develop a multitenant application running on the Kyma environment of the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) extending SAP S/4 HANA Cloud.

Due to the complexity of this topic, our team has taken some compromise compared to a real application. So, this application doesn't aim to be used for productive usage.

The repository has been structured into 2 different sections:
* [documentation](/documentation/README.md): Here you will find details about the architecture, the components, and a step-by-step guide to set up the application EasyFranchise.
* [code](/code/README.md): Here you will find the code of all the components needed to run the application.

## Who Is This Tutorial For?
The business scenario of this tutorial has been created with the partner as focus persona. The purpose of this project is to help SAP partners to get a quick start on developing a multitenant application and provide best practices.
This is of course not exclusively for SAP partner and can be very useful for every person looking for details on how to build a multitenant application running on Kyma. It is suitable for new or experienced developers on SAP BTP. 

## Focus Topics of the Tutorial
The tutorial focus on the following aspects:
- Multitenancy

- Extension SaaS (extending an SAP LoB solution), not a standalone SaaS
